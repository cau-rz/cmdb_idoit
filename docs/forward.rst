=======

This project is an API-wrapper around the JSON-API of `i-doit`, which itself is a 
Configuration Management Database, short `cmdb`. Initially this project started to abstract
the annoying handling of JSON calls and session handling, but quickly grew into a layer
of mitigating around glitches in the API itself and providing a more sane access to the objects
stored in the cmdb.

Our mission is to provide an easy and stable way to integrate `i-doit` into your datacenter applications,
by providing tools and library methods to access and store objects with high-level language features
provided by python3. 

We believe a API should provide data in the same way it processes them, should return values according
to their types in the same format for all data structures and should be developer friendly in all thinkable
ways.
